The text also criticizes the Department of Justice for allegedly forcing school districts to appease transgender extremists. It advocates for the reversal of policies allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military due to the claim of incompatibility between gender dysphoria and military service. The text also suggests the reissue of a stronger transgender national coverage determination, limiting the application of sex discrimination protections to sexual orientation and transgender status only in hiring and firing decisions. Additionally, the text proposes rescinding regulations prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status."

It suggests that the 'woke' agenda and its influence are widespread, encompassing governmental and educational institutions, military, commercial sectors, and non-profit organizations. Furthermore, the text criticizes the influence of woke culture as a form of totalitarian cult-like behavior. It argues that a hypothetical future conservative president should take measures to mitigate the influence of woke culture by adjusting bureaucratic operations, federal spending, and administrative operations. The author criticizes companies for succumbing to the 'woke' agenda over their workers and customers, allegedly prioritizing foreign investors' interest. Additionally, there seems to be a call for a stronger focus on traditional American values, such as patriotism and colorblindness, over the ideologically driven agenda of wokeness."

The function of OLA is emphasized as the liaison between the White House and Congress. There is also substantial emphasis on the role of a conservative president in looking to the legislative branch for decisive action, and the need to align the executive branch on legislative proposals and language. Multiple legislative proposals and reforms across different sectors, such as housing, healthcare, education, agriculture, and technology are advocated. These reforms range from policy changes, regulatory modifications, to transparency and accountability in processes. The next administration is encouraged to coordinate with Congress on these legislative changes to efficiently implement their agenda. Additionally, consolidation of offices into one for efficiency is suggested, specifically the OLA and the office of public affairs."

       "The keyword \"align\" is featured in discussions about assembling a team of conservatives to dismantle bureaucracy and realign government institutions according to conservative values and objectives. It mentions the importance of having federal employees, policy councils, and national security staff align with the president's agenda and conservatism in order to effectively implement policies and meet national security goals. Several government departments and agencies - including a future conservative Justice Department, Federal Reserve, Federal Communications Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - should align their missions, policies, resources, and personnel with a conservative leadership and its priorities. The alignment implied in the text involves a more efficient use of resources, better collaboration between agencies, and a unified direction toward the president's goals. Alignment also refers to reforms including labor and civil service, immigrational law enforcement, trade violations, politically-oriented appointments, environmental regulations, energy dominance as a foreign policy component, and alignment of foreign assistance with national interests. Misalignment, particularly in areas such as ideology and policy execution, is identified as a significant challenge to effective governance."
